// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {
  // your code goes here
//check obj - start from '{' end '}'
//check : if there is between : and , it is a value of the obj
//string - check if there is " " 
//check number - use inNaN
//boolean - check if first char is t or f
//array - check if it starts with '[' 


};
